## ioslides

<b> header </b> 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

title: "Introducing Shiny and RStudio"
author: "Assa Yeroslaviz - Dept. Computational Biology"
output: 
  ioslides_presentation:
        widescreen: true
        transition: faster

```

## ioslides

<b> Slide with Bullets </b>

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

---

## ioslides

<b> Slide with R Output </b>

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

---

## ioslides

<b> Slide with Plot </b>

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

sizes <- expand.grid(size = (0:3) * 2, stroke = (0:3) * 2)
ggplot(sizes, aes(size, stroke, size = size, stroke = stroke)) + 
  geom_abline(slope = -1, intercept = 6, colour = "white", size = 6) + 
  geom_point(shape = 21, fill = "red") +
  scale_size_identity()

advanced possibilities for interactive presentations

for more information see [slidify](http://slidify.org/) (http://slidify.org/)

similar functionality as Latex

## Install packages

- `Slidify` works in R, so you need to download [that](http://cran.r-project.org) if you haven't yet.
- You also need to make sure you have all of the necessary dependencies installed on your computer
- Open R and copy and paste the following code into the console (you only need to do this once)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")  
install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv')  
install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv')
```

## Publishing

slidify allows the user to directly publish or share the results as well as the analysis method via different repositories.
This is easily done with e.g. 

- [github](github.com)
- [rpubs](rpubs.com)
- [dropbox](dropbox.com)

```{r}
library(slidify)
publish_github("myDeck", username="frymor")
```
